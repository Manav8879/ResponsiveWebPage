            <p>Football, also known as soccer, is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is the most popular sport in the world, played by over 250 million players in over 200 countries.</p>
            <p>The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end. The objective of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal. The team with the most goals at the end of the match wins. Football is governed by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), which organizes the FIFA World Cup every four years.</p>
            <p>Each team consists of a goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders, and forwards. The goalkeeper is the only player allowed to use their hands and arms to block the ball, while other players must use their feet, head, or other parts of their body (except hands and arms) to play the ball. The game starts with a kickoff and is played over two halves of 45 minutes each, with a 15-minute halftime break.</p>
            <p>The popularity of football has led to the development of major leagues and tournaments, such as the English Premier League, La Liga, UEFA Champions League, and many others. These competitions bring together the best teams and players from around the world, showcasing their skills and creating unforgettable moments for fans.</p>
            <p>Whether played professionally or recreationally, football has a universal appeal that transcends cultures and languages. It is a sport that brings people together, fostering a sense of community and shared passion.</p>
